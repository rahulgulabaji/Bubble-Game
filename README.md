# Bubble Game - Test Your Reflexes!

**A fun and addictive online game developed by Rahul Gulabaji where you test your reflexes by clicking the matching bubble before time runs out.**

## Description

Bubble Game is a simple yet engaging web-based game designed to challenge your speed and accuracy. The objective is to quickly identify the target number displayed as the "HIT" value and click on the corresponding bubble within the grid before the timer reaches zero. Developed by Rahul Gulabaji, this game offers a quick and enjoyable way to test your reflexes online for free.

## How to Play

1.  **Focus on the "HIT" Value:** At the top of the game panel, a target number will appear under the "HIT" label.
2.  **Scan and Click:** Look at the colorful grid of bubbles below. Each bubble contains a random number. Find the bubble that matches the current "HIT" value and click on it.
3.  **Earn Points:** Successfully clicking the correct bubble before the timer expires will increase your "SCORE" by 10 points.
4.  **Keep Going:** After a correct hit, a new "HIT" value will be generated, a fresh set of bubbles will appear, and the timer will reset to 60 seconds, allowing you to continue playing.
5.  **Game Over:** If the timer reaches zero before you can click the matching bubble, the game ends, and the bubble area will be cleared. Refresh the page to start a new game.
